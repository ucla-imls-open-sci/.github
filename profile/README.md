Hello this is the UCLA IMLS Open Science github. Our goal is develop and create 14 Open Science Lessons for librarians to use and learn from. 
These lessons seek to support continued skills development for librarians in open science to effectively provide instruction to new researchers 
and effectively collaborate with faculty and researchers in science projects using open science practices. In here you will find these Open Science Lessons in and out of development using the Carpentries Workbench.
