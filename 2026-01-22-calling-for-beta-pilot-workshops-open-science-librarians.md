Since 2022, the UCLA Library, with support from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), has been developing a set of open, modular lessons to support librarians in practicing and teaching open science. These lessons are being developed using The Carpentries lesson template and workflows, and are designed to help librarians support researchers across the research lifecycle, including data management, qualitative research, reproducibility, research infrastructure, and community engagement.

Several lessons have now reached **alpha status**, and the project team is seeking community members and certified Carpentries Instructors to host and teach [beta pilot workshops]({{< param handbook_url >}}/resources/curriculum/lesson-life-cycle.html) during 2025 and 2026.

## Lesson Profile

The following **alpha-stage lessons** are ready for beta piloting.

### A Path to Open, Inclusive, and Collaborative Science for Librarians

* **Lesson site:** https://librarycarpentry.github.io/lc-collaborative-science/  
* **Lesson repository:** https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-collaborative-science  

This lesson introduces librarians to open science as a set of values, practices, and community norms. It emphasizes inclusive and collaborative approaches to open scholarship and provides a foundation for supporting open research across disciplines.

---

### Data Management (and Sharing) Plans for Librarians 101

* **Lesson site:** https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-dmp101/  
* **Lesson repository:** https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-dmp101  

This lesson prepares librarians to understand, evaluate, and support data management and sharing plans. It focuses on practical workflows, funder requirements, and the role libraries play in supporting researchers throughout the data lifecycle.

---

### Open Qualitative Research

* **Lesson site:** https://librarycarpentry.github.io/lc-open-qualitative-research/  
* **Lesson repository:** https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-open-qualitative-research  

This lesson introduces open practices in qualitative research, including data ethics, documentation, sharing considerations, and tools commonly used in qualitative workflows.

---

### Authoring Open Science

* **Lesson site:** https://ucla-imls-open-sci.info/lc-authoring-open-science/  
* **Lesson repository:** https://github.com/ucla-imls-open-sci/lc-authoring-open-science  

This lesson focuses on open authoring practices, including transparent writing workflows, licensing, attribution, and reproducible documentation. It is designed to help librarians support researchers producing open scholarly outputs.

---

### A Gentle, Hands-on Introduction to Containers and Virtual Machines

* **Lesson site:** https://ual-re.github.io/lc-containers_vms/  
* **Lesson repository:** https://github.com/UAL-RE/lc-containers_vms  

This lesson introduces librarians to containers and virtual machines as tools for reproducibility and research infrastructure, using hands-on examples designed for audiences with little prior systems experience.

---

### Leveraging Open Research and Contributor IDs (ORCID) for Librarians

* **Lesson site:** https://firbolg.github.io/LC_ORCID/  
* **Lesson repository:** https://github.com/firbolg/LC_ORCID  

This lesson prepares librarians to support ORCID adoption and integration, focusing on researcher identifiers, attribution, and connections between ORCID and open research infrastructure.

---

### Target Audience

These lessons are aimed at academic and research librarians, data and digital scholarship staff, and library workers supporting open science, research data services, or research software. Most lessons assume little to no prior computational experience, unless otherwise noted.

## State of Development

All lessons listed above have completed initial authoring and editorial review and are currently at **alpha stage** in the Carpentries Incubator. Beta piloting will help validate lesson scope, timing, instructional flow, and audience fit as these lessons move toward broader adoption within Library Carpentry.

## How You Can Help Develop These Lessons

**Please try teaching one or more of these lessons and let us know how it goes.**

Our goal is to support these lessons through community piloting and, ultimately, submission for adoption within Library Carpentry. Feedback from beta pilots is a critical part of this process.

If you are willing and able to teach one of these lessons in a beta pilot workshop, please let us know by opening an issue using the Pilot Interest template in the UCLA IMLS Open Science GitHub organization:

https://github.com/ucla-imls-open-sci

The project team and lesson authors would be happy to meet with you to answer questions and help you prepare for a pilot workshop.

After a pilot is complete, we ask instructors and hosts to submit feedback based on their experience via GitHub issues. We would also welcome the opportunity to meet again to debrief and discuss next steps.

## Acknowledgments

These lessons were developed through a collaborative, community-driven process involving librarians, researchers, and open science practitioners. We thank all lesson authors, reviewers, and contributors, as well as The Carpentries community, for their ongoing support.
